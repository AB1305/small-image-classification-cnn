- **CNN Architecture**: Implements a deep learning model tailored for image classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices.
- **Scalable**: The system can be extended to accommodate larger and more complex datasets.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras for model building and training.
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
